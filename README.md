he app is hosted at http://qqttss.github.io/module4-solution

The application has 3 views (i.e., 3 view states): home (home), categories list (categories), items list (items).

When the user goes to / path in your application, a home screen should be shown. It's up to you what you place on the home screen. You can just say "Welcome to our Restaurant". The home screen should have a link to a list of categories of menu items in the restaurant. Clicking that link would obviously take the user to the /categories view.

The categories view should list all available categories of items on the menu. Each listing should be a link. Clicking that link should take the user to the /items view. Note that since what the items view state shows is dependent on which category the user clicked, the URL mapping will need to have a parameter in it. I.e., don't take the URLs I am listing in the assignment description as literal URLs. They are just naming hints.
